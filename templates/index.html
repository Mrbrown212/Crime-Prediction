        <p id="introduction">
            In order to better understand crime patterns and predict potential crime hotspots, law enforcement agencies
            are finding that crime rate prediction is an invaluable tool. Law enforcement organisations can more
            effectively direct resources to regions that are anticipated to see spikes in criminal activity by
            forecasting future crime trends. Both a general decline in crime and an improvement in public safety could
            result from this. Predicting crime rates can also assist law enforcement agencies in creating more effective
            plans for handling crimes as they occur.

            <br> <br>
            The Police recorded crime and outcomes open data tables publication, which is accessible on the official UK
            government website, is the basis for the manual preparation of the dataset. Statistics on crimes committed
            in 19 Police Force Areas between 2014 and 2021 are provided by this data.
            We can forecast the crime rates for 10 distinct categories of crimes that are anticipated to occur in the
            19 Police Force Areas over the course of the upcoming few years with the aid of this application. It
            contains data on 10 distinct categories of criminal activity, such as Criminal damage and arson, Drug
            offences, Miscellaneous crimes against society, Possession of weapons, Public order offences, Robbery, Sexual offences, Theft
            offences, Violence against the person.

            <br><br>
            The Random Forest Regression model from scikit-learn, which accepts year, city name, and crime type data as
            inputs, is used by the system. One kind of ensemble learning technique that can be used to forecast
            continuous values from a set of data is Random Forest Regression. In order for it to function, a huge number
            of "decision trees" that each predict something about the target variable are created. After that, a final
            prediction is generated by averaging each prediction. Because of this, it is more accurate than a single
            decision tree. Using the testing dataset, the model predicts the crime rate with a 81.20% accuracy rate.
